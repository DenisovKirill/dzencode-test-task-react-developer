# dZENcode Test Task - React Developer

## Description

This project is a test task for the position of **React Developer**. It demonstrates working with Next.js, React components, routing, and database integration using Supabase.
Additionally, it uses **Server-Sent Events (SSE)** to show the number of active sessions in real time across different browser instances instead of **Socket.io**, as the project is based on Next.js and deployed on Vercel.
